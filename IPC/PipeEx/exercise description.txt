Exercise:1
----------------
- Send bytes from Producer (parent) to Consumer
  (child)
- Producer sends N messages,
  Consumer reads in a forever loop
- Use usleep() to simulate work load
- Discover how different timing influence number
  of reads


Exercise: 2
----------------
- Create/Destroy special fifo file
- Send bytes from Producer (Ping) to Consumer (Pong)
- Ping sends N messages, Pong reads in a forever loop
- Use usleep() to simulate work load
- Discover how different timing influence number of reads
