Phase A:
	High level design:
		what sub modules are there?
		what is the public interface of the executor?
	internal data structures to be used
	
Phase B:
	High level design document
	Control flow in pseudo code (does this contain sub modules?)
	Module header file (is this suppose to be one header file?)
	
Phase C:
	C Header file fully documented
	C source code files
	makefile that creates a lib and test
	A test program with more than 5 tasks
