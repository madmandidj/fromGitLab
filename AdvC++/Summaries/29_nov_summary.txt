Pre code review:
----------------
numeric_limits<T>::max;

Thread(Runnable r)    **Runnable is an interface
.
.
.
r->run()
.
.
.

Threadable<...,...> inherits from Runnable


***********
with tasks that we dont know how long they will take its a good idea to add a timeout.
enum should be put within relevant namespace, and also better to have it as part of a class.

Task
^
|
|
Taskable(obj,(T::*func)
***********
template<class T>
class MyTask : public Task
	MyTask<DNA_analyzer> dnaATask;


Task* task = MakeTask(moshe);
********
Task should be a shared pointer

Better to have:
try{
	DoX();
	DoY();
	DoZ();
}catch(exception&){

}
rather than three different try catchs
