1) Scope:
---------
SmartBuilding is a next generation platform for managing IoT enhanced smart
building. The platform serves as the controller and integration hub for modules,
devices, controllers and sensors that will enable efficient and comfortable
operation of the building.

a. Provide a high level design
b. Provide a detailed level design
c. Provide an implementation using C++ for a POSIX compliant system.


2) Introduction:
----------------



3) High Level Requirements:
---------------------------
The project will implement the BAS layer of the smart building system. The BAS layer provides a server application that act as a central hub to mediate between software agents responsible for communication with the actual hardware device. Building Automation Systems (BAS).
The platforms have the following components:
	A) Management and Central Hub- a server application that serves mainly as a host for software agents representing the devices. Provides an efficient mechanism to receive events from sensors and dispatch these events to relevant controllers.
	B) Events- The system will enable devices to generate and send custom events. Events will be generated by sensor agents and will be consumed by controller agents. An event will consist of a type/topic, location info and arbittrary agent event specific payload.
	C) Devices- The system will enable a operator to configure and install software agents that mediate communication with external hardware devices.
These devices can act as:
	Sensor
	Controller
	D) Connected Alerts- To notify Web-based monitoring systems of unusual activity, such as unathorized movement through the building or exceeded utilities usage. NOT PART OF VERSION 1.0
	


4) System Description:
----------------------
SmartHome consists of a server that manages a set of sensors and controllers as specified by a configuration file. It will route events generated by the sensors to the controllers interested to act upon these events.
	A) Server- central piece of software that manages all the devices via software agents. 
		* Loading and configuring the device agents.
		* Enable sensors to publish events
		* Enable controllers to receive events of interested
		* Enable a user to view a live log of event flow
On startup, the startup will read a configuration file describing what devices are installed in the building. this file will enable the server to create the agents objects representing the devices and initialize those agent objects.
It will also manage the events distribution within the system. it will enable a sensor to publish an event and a controller to consume to a specific event.
	B) Sensors & Controllers- Sensors and controlelrs are devices connected to the building network and communicate with the server via an agent object loaded by the server. e.g. Smoke detectors, lights controller, doors and locks.
		B)1) An agent is the software entity loaded by the server to represent an actual device and will allow the basic interaction between server and devices. Agents will be loaded at system startup according to a configuration file. Each agent is implemented as a dynamic obejct (.SO) (we get these from the companies) and will implement and expose the required interfaces in order to communicate with the server.
