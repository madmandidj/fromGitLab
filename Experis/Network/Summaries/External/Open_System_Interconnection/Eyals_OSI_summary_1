1 - physical - 
conveys the bit stream (electrical impulse, light or radio signal) through physical connections, wires, connectors.
Provides the hardware a means of sending and receiving data on a carrier.


2 - data link - 
Media Access Control (MAC) layer, and Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.
The MAC sub layer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit it.
The LLC layer controls from synchronization, flow control and error checking. acts as interface between MAC and network layer.


3 - network 
Provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths (virtual circuits) for transmitting data from node to node.
routing, forwarding, addressing, internetworking, error handling, congestion control and packet sequencing are functions of this layer.

4 - transport
Transparent transfer of data between end systems (hosts) and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. ensures complete data transfer.

5 - session
establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications.

6 - presentation
Provides independence from differences in data representation (encryption) by translating from application to network format and vice versa.
Works to transform data into the form that the application layer can accept,  and also formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network, providing freedom from compatibility problems. Sometimes called the syntax layer.

7 - application
Supports application and end-user processes. communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered. Everything at this layer is application specific.
