Problem with select():
----------------------
Problem:	A client that connected and fell asleep ... i have no indication that he is not active.
Solution: 	Timeout



example:
T/O = 5 mins


activity = select(........, T/O);
GetTime();
Calculate time + T/O; ----> this is the timestamp

*** if activity == 0 it means that there was a timeout.

linked list:
fd1  -> fd2 -> fd3 -> fd4 -> ground

if fd3 is active, then move to beginning of list.
Then, the new timeout is calculate with the time of last in list.


Homework:
1. Working with select
2. Working with select and timeout.
