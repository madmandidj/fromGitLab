Make comms more usable with c++ (We're doing TCP and IPv4):
--------------------------------

--------
PHASE 1 (select not needed, cna use threads or deal with only 1 client):
--------
We will need: 
Socket (3 types: server(bind listen accept), client(connect), socket allocated by server when client did connect.) 
(in windows API is similar but socket is not necessarily an int). A typedef is not enough, need a new type.
htons
address (need to be able to get by name)
--------
PHASE 2
--------
Select/epoll (give him a container of sockets and returns the relevant sockets)
