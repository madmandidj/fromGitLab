SCOPE
*******
Charging functionality and charging management is GSM/UMTS and EPS networks.

This document describes the handling of CDR files by a processor for charging purposes.
Charging is mediated  by processing large files containing CDR records describing services consumed by subscribers.

Each CDR record contains descriptions of charging events such as voice calls and SMS messages.

The processor will produce billing for subscribers and for third party operators that were involved in the service.

CHARGING MECHANISMS
*******
Three types of networks:
GSM / UMTS / EPC

Three levels of charging mechanisms:
bearer- 		the network,
subsystem-		the subscriber (IMSI),
service-		(e.g. MMS or SMS)

Real-time monitoring of resource usage on all three levels to detect relevant chargeable events.
Network resource usage is a voice call of certain duration, transport of certain volume of data, etc...
Network resource usage requests may be initiated by: 
UE - 		MO case: Mobile Originated
network -   MT case:


*******
CDR FILE FORMAT
*******
header section
variable sized CDR data section - contains 0 or more concatenated CDR records.
(e.g.
header
CDR 1
CDR 2

.
CDR N

*******
CDR Format
*******
CDR record is composed of the following fields seperated by |

IMSI - International Mobile Subscriber Identity (max 15 digits)
MSISDN - uniquely identifying a subscription in a mobile network (max 15 digits)
IMEI - Subscriber equipment number field contains ID of mobile device
Operator Brand Name - e.g. "Cellcom Israel"(max 64 chars)
Operator MCC/MNC tuple - Mobile country code (3 digit), Mobile Network Code (2-3 digits)
Call type: 
	MOC			outgoing voice call
	MTC			incoming voice call
	SMS-NO		outgoing message
	SMS-MT		incoming message
	GPRS		internet
Call date
call time
duration
download
upload
party MSISDN - 		corresponding party in this call, empty for GPRS
party operator-		corresponding partys mobile operator in this calls
	



*******
PROCESSING FUNCTIONS
*******
The processor of the CDR files will be fed daily CDR files in a specific configurable directory.
Usually are large files 1-5 GB
Processor will read and process files in order to fulfill the following functions:

***BILLING
for each customer identified by IMSI an aggregate information will be produced that will contain the total of:
Outgoing voice calls duration to a subscriber within the mobile operator
Incoming voice calls duration to a subscriber within the mobile operator
Outgoing voice calls duration to a subscriber outside the mobile operator
Incoming voice calls duration to a subscriber outside the mobile operator
SMS messages sent within the mobile operator
SMS received within the mobile operator
SMS sent outside the mobile operator
SMS received outside the mobile operatore
MB downloaded
MB uploaded


***INTER OPERATOR SETTLEMENT
Incoming voice call curations
Outgoing voice call durations
Incoming SMS messages
Outgoing SMS messages



*******
CHARGING GATEWAY FUNCTIONS
*******
The CGF enables interrogation of the system for agrregated data.
Phase A: support human user
Phase B: support for external systems integration via an API.

CGF will support the following commands:
***MSISDN Retrieve Query:
Support retrieving information for one subscriber at a time. The subscriber will be identified by his MSISDN. The result will be formatted according to the description of one record.

***Operator Retrieve Query
Support retrieving information for one operator at a time. The operator will be identified by his MCC/MNC Th result will be formatted according to blah blah.

***All Subscribers Report
Produce one file with one record for each subscriber containing aggregated information. This aggregate information will be imported to other sustems for purposes such as billing. Also should be formatted appropriately.

***All Operators Reports
Produce one file with one record for each operator containing aggregated information to be used in inter-operator settlement process.

***Aggregated information
Produce charging files on recepit of triggers. These charging files contain aggregated data for subscribers and operators
